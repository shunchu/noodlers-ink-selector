# Noodler's Ink Selector

Pick your favorite Noodler's ink based on spcial ink properties baked into them that made their inks special!

See the selector in action: https://shunchu.github.io/noodlers-ink-selector/.

**Credit:** Data used here are provided by [Noodler's Ink Properties spreadsheet](http://noodlersink.com/noodlers-ink-properties/).
I merely made the data interactive. Please file an issue if you see a mistake in one of the inks and its properties. I'll fix them ASAP. 
Or feel free to fork and make a pull request for any fixes or feature expansions.
